#### Description:
Hello everyone, my name is Ritin and this is my simple project for the game of Connect Four
I believe everyone is familiar with the game of connect four; if not, then let me help you.
The game starts with two players each with coins of different colors, and the goal is very simple, to get your matching coins
four in a row. It can be anyway: vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. The first person to do so, wins; simple right?
Well that is pretty much it, please feel free to experiment around and take a look at the code.
The insipartion for this project came from my comp sci class in high school, where we also had to make a final project.
So, I made the connect four game there but it was a terminal window based. So, I just developed on that and used the skills I learned throughout this class
to make it into a web-based game
The game starts off by asking for the players name.
They then can continue to play the game as intended and can also reset the game usning a button
at any time to clear the game borad and start again.
Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game,
in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
Connect Four is a two-player game with perfect information for both sides. This term describes games where one player at a time plays, players have all the information about moves that have taken place and all moves that can take place, for a given game state. Connect Four also belongs to the classification of an adversarial, zero-sum game, since a player's advantage is an opponent's disadvantage.

One measure of complexity of the Connect Four game is the number of possible games board positions. 
For classic Connect Four played on 6 high, 7 wide grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 positions[5] for all game boards populated with 0 to 42 pieces.

The game was first solved by James Dow Allen (October 1, 1988), and independently by Victor Allis (October 16, 1988).[6] Allis describes a knowledge-based approach,[7] with nine strategies, as a solution for Connect Four.
Allen also describes winning strategies[8][9] in his analysis of the game. At the time of the initial solutions for Connect Four, brute-force analysis was not deemed feasible given the game's complexity
and the computer technology available at the time. Connect Four has since been solved with brute-force methods, beginning with John Tromp's work in compiling an 8-ply database[6][10] (February 4, 1995).
The artificial intelligence algorithms able to strongly solve Connect Four are minimax or negamax, with optimizations that include alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, and transposition tables.
The code for solving Connect Four with these methods is also the basis for the Fhourstones[11] integer performance benchmark.
The solved conclusion for Connect Four is first player win. With perfect play, the first player can force a win,[6][7][8] on or before the 41st move[12] by starting in the middle column. The game is a theoretical draw when the first player starts in the columns adjacent to the center. For the edges of the game board, column 1 and 2 on left (or column 7 and 6 on right), the exact move-value score for first player start is loss on the 40th move,[12] and loss on the 42nd move,[12] respectively. In other words, by starting with the four outer columns, the first player allows the second player to force a win.
